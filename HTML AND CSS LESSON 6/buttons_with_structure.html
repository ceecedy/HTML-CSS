<!-- Link element is required to connect with another files such as html, css, or even javascript. It is not
        requiring any closing tag. e.g. "</link>"
            - Link requires two arguments, one is "rel" or relation, what's gonna be the relation of an html file
                to the file we are going to connect. On this case, it will be stylesheet because it's CSS we would 
                like to connect.
            - arguments of the link will be its attribute. 
            - The second argument that the link requires is the href or the file reference to be linked on this file. 
                on this case it would be the "buttons_css_separated.css" 
            - be reminded that the href from the link will only find the particular file that is within the same folder 
                as the primary file or current file. 
            - to link a file from a different folder, you need to give it's starting path until you reach the file you 
                want to link. -->

        



<!-- HTML without closing tag are called void elements. -->
