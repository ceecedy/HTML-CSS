<!-- HTML STRUCTURE -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> is a preprocessor of the html file to be determined by the browser in order to know
        what kind of file it is. DOCTYPE html also dictates the browser to use the modern html processing. 
        Without the doctype tag, it will just use the old html processing that has less features. -->

<!-- Next is the "<html> </html>" body, this tag is where you put all your html elements. -->

<!-- Next is the "<head> </head>" body, this tag is where you put all your headers or titles. --> 

<!-- Last is the "<body> </body>", body, this tag is where you put all your contents and others. -->

<!-- The structure above is the proper structure of HTML code. -->

<!-- The tag that has tag inside or even more tag is called a nesting. -->

<!-- every HTML file has only one html tag, it represents the entire webpage and is designed for nesting. -->

<!-- the body element contains all visible elements. -->

<!-- the head element contains some tags that are not visible but can affect the html file. like the style tag. -->

<!-- Title tag to the head tag will change your tab's name -->

<!-- You can use live server - an extension to vscode to automatically reload the webpage of an html file 
    whenever you update the code of it. -->
