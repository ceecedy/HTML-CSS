<!-- Another void element to be used is the image. The tag is <img> and since it was void, it will have no 
    closing tag. 
        - it only requires one attribute which is src or source. -->

<!-- object fit = a css property that is specified only on images. This property will be casted if the img
    given doesn't match the dimension of the img or the shapes. E.g. if 300px is not a match on the img
    then the object fit will be casted together with its value.-->

<!-- Another void element is the input. The tag is <input>. It requires several attribute, one is the type 
    that can be a text, it can be checkbox, and many more. 
        - you can also put an attribute called placeholder. It is used as a hint to the input boxes. -->
