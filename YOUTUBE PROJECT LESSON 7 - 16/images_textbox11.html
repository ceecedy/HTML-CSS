<!--
Take note that the HTML Combines multiple spaces together and it might affect your elements.
    - Just for instance. the div element. 
        - If you have two div's that has space in one div container, that two div's can affect the 
        output by showing a space on the particlular div container. 


Refer to Scratches and look for the grid html and css for lesson 11. 

    There's a special attribute in the html that can be given to div. That is the style. 
        - E.g. <div style = "edit your css code here"> Div 1 </div>
    As you can see in the quoted text, in special attribute style, you can edit right immediately your own
    css design in the attribute as value. 
    This are also called inline styles. 

    Grid - is a layout that has rows and columns. 
    to declare grid, it is in css property "display: grid;"
    
    grid-template-columns is a css property that defines the size of a column in the grid. 
    Per value given in the grid-template-columns, it is taking one cell. 

    fr - free space. Is a special value in grid. It means to take the rest of the space in side the grid. 
        - E.g. 1fr 
        - The number value in the fr will compare to other value that has fr so they can know how much 
        in the remaining space will they get. 
        - Think of the two fr values as ratio. That's how they will share on each other.
