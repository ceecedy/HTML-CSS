<!-- In HTML, there's a 3 types of element
        1. Block element - it takes up one entire line. E.g. <p> Hello! </p> 
            - block actually takes the entire line. 
        2. Inline-block element - Only takes as much space as needed. 
            - E.g. images, input. 
        3. Inline Element - appear within a line of text. Basically a text element. 
            - E.g. <strong>, <u>, <span> -->
